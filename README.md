Please see instructions below to run the scripts in this repo,

1. Download Electric Power Consumption dataset and save the zip file in your desired folder
2. Unzip the zip file in the same folder. A text file called household_power_consumption.txt should appear
3. Set the working directory to the folder where the text file is saved
4. At this point, you are good run all the 4 scripts and the corresponding plots should appear
5. I removed the ? from the dataset and replaced the original file with a file with only the dates as per project instruction

Thanks,
